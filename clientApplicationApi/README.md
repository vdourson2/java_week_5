# Client Application API

* Type of challenge: **Project**
* Duration: **unknown**
* Team challenge: **solo**  

## Learning objectives
- Understand how to build a client application that communicates with API endpoints.
- Gain experience in using a framework for making POST and GET requests.

## Requirements
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Familiarity with API concepts and HTTP methods (POST and GET).

## The Mission

Keep it simple for this one. Just write a small application that can perform a POST request and a GET request to some of the
API endpoints you just created in the previous challenge. This application doesn't need to resemble something you would
present to actual users. You are a developers, and sometimes developers needs custom made tools to test something, to try
out something, etc. The main idea here is that you at least have experienced building a client using a framework. 

You can try using spring resttemplate or something more lightweight such as Retrofit.
